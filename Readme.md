Welcome to the ACM Robot Building Workshop! In this event, you'll learn how to build and program the **Freenove Micro:Rover**, a fun and interactive micro:bit-powered robot. This guide will help you get started with assembling the robot, connecting your micro:bit, and programming it using Microsoft's [MakeCode Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/).

## üöó What You‚Äôll Need

- Freenove Micro:Rover Kit
- BBC micro:bit board (v1 or v2)
- 18650 battery (not included in the kit) (You can still use the robot without this but you need to keep the micro USB cable plugged in)
- Micro USB cable (Used for charging and programming the robot)
- A computer (Windows/Mac/Linux/Chromebook) with a USB port
